## Description
We were given a starter code for this assignment (found at: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka.git) which contained all of the public/front-end development already. I then used Express.js to create a server as well as both HTML and API routes. The application allows you to write and save notes, as well as delete them. It is deployed via Heroku at: https://gentle-bastion-46524.herokuapp.com/.
